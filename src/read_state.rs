//! Machine-local "have I read this file" tracking.
//!
//! A file is *read* when we have recorded the mtime it had at the moment it was
//! read, and the file's current mtime still matches. A file is *unread* when we
//! have no record for it, or its current mtime differs from the recorded one —
//! i.e. it was created, or changed since it was last read.
//!
//! State lives in md-tui's own state dir (not in any browsed repo), so it never
//! syncs across machines and never lands in git. It is keyed by absolute path.
//! Storage format is one `mtime\tpath` line per entry — no extra dependency.
